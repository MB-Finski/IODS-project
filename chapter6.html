<p>As you can see above, the data consists of 16 rats total. Group 1 has 8 rats and groups 2 and 3 have 4 rats. Conveniently there are no missing values so we won’t have to replace them or remove rats from the analysis. However, it should be noted that not all time intervals are equivalent.</p>
<p>At a quick glance, the data seems quite normally distributed. It noticeable how the starting levels for the mice’s weights are quite different. Also there seems to be quite a bit of difference in the variance of weight in the different groups which is not explained by the variables difference in mean magnitude (e.g. compare groups 2 and 3).</p>
<p>Now, the intention of this first part is to avoid proper longitudinal modeling of the data and, instead, analyze the data using a suitable summary variable.</p>
<p>However, we must first get a better grip at what’s going on. Let’s do some graphical exploration of the data:</p>

<hr />
<p>From the graphs we could hypothesize that one particular rat (ID = 12) in group 2 may even have switched groups or is simply an aberrant observation (if not ourlier) in it’s intercept weight. Infact, it very much seems that groups 2 and 3 are actually part of the one and same group. Judging wether this sinqular observation in a group of 4 observations is an outlier is quite unreliable, so we’ll let it be. Also, ID = 2 that is shown as an outlier in the boxplots, should not be considered an outlier with such a low n. This is especially true when considering that this observation is contained well within the 3*IQR limits.</p>
<p>Ultimately, what we should analyze in the data depends entirely on what our research question is. The instructions for this chapter leave this quite unclear and upto interpretation. Keeping with the theme of Chapter 8 in MABS, let’s assume we’d be interested in overall mean weight of the rats over the whole study period. As a secondary outcome measure let’s also consider the mean weight after eliminating the effect of the baseline weight (just like in MABS Chapter 8).</p>
<p>There’s one cruacial difference in the RATS and BPRS data that we should consider while implementing the MABS Chapter 8 analysis: our RATS data does not have equal time intervals. Therefore, comparing the overall group means is not applicable here. Instead, we should compare the mean AUC of the weight for each group.</p>

<p>From the box plot we can see that in group 1 the outlier is now more than 3*IQR from the median. However, as stated before, given the extremely small sample size one should be weary of excluding ourliers. So we’ll leave it be. Also, groups 2 and 3 show somewhat skewed distributions. We’ll also ignore this in running the anova.</p>
<p>Similarly, we’ll not cover the assumptions of ANOVA, as this has not been covered in this course, so we’ll just conveniently ingnore them…</p>

<p>So, yes, there’s a quite significant difference in mean AUC of weight between the groups. Specifically between groups 1 and 2 (p&lt;0.001) and 1 and 3 (p&lt;0.001) but not 2 and 3 (p=0.29).</p>
<p>We can see how much the starting weight had influence in this outcome by simply substracting baseline weight auc (over whole study period) from the “weight_auc”. This is cheating a little bit, perhaps, but the outcome is the same as running a regression model and including the basline weight as a covariate as was done in the Data camp exercise.</p>

<p>Somewhat surprisingly there seems to be a statistically significant difference in the mean weights for groups 1 and 2 after adjusting for the baseline weight. It seems that the added mean weight, over the whole study period, is 1103 gram<em>days higher for the group 2 than group 1 (95% CI: 42.34 - 2164, p = 0.04). </em>Ex post facto*, evidence of this result could already be seen in the initial standardized graph.</p>
<p>This result would suggest that we should perhaps take a closer look at the growth rates in the data. For this purpose a LMM is the best choice.</p>

<hr />
<p>As can be seen from above, the analysis of the effect slices (or comparison of group-wise slopes of weight) shows that, in absolute terms, Group 2 gained more in mean weight over the study period as compared to group 1 (p=0.005). The difference was non-significant between the other group combinations.</p>
<p>Now, compared to the AUC analysis, the interpretation of this result is quite different. Now we can say that group 2 gained more weight over the study period whereas in the AUC analysis we could only say that the mean weight change beyond baseline was more positive over all timepoints during the study. In light of the AUC it would’ve been even possible that group 2 finished the study with a lower weight than group 1 if the mean weigh was greater over other timepoints.</p>
<p>All in all, the LMM was quite a bit more eloquent and protected us from issues with multiplicity.</p>

<p>The chapter 9 of MABS covers LMM analysis for data with normal response variables. As I have some passing experience with hierachical LMM already through my adventures in biostatistics, I’ll perform the LMM as I’d do from previous experience. You can evaluate the results as compared to what’s contained in the chapter 9 of MABS.</p>
<p>The relevant assumptions of LMM are as follows: Statistical assumption | Method used to verify/analyze — | ————- The chosen model is appropriate for the studied effect (i.e. linear) | Visual inspection of model residuals plotted against within subject factors The residuals of the model are normally distributed | Visual inspection of the Q-Q plots of the residuals The variance of residuals is homogeneous vs fitted value | Visual inspenction of pearson residual vs fitted value No significant outliers/influential observations | Cook’s distance, DFBeta S, Restricted maximum likelihood distance etc. Random effects are normally distributed | None; a theoretical assumption.</p>

<hr />
<p>As can be seen from the table, the data consists of 40 subjects divided evenly into two separate treatment groups. The response variable is the subjects score of Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) at baseline and exactly 1 week intervals thereafter for a total of 8 weeks (9 follow ups in total). The research question is: did the BPRS scores or their change (=slope) differ for the treatment 1 and 2 groups over the study period.</p>
<p>As can be seen from the above table, there are no missing data. This would not have been an issue either way since LMM is able to deal with missing observations on a case-by-case basis. The data is relatively normally distributed, although there seems to be some extreme observations based on the range of variables. Let’s explore the data more with the aid of some graphs.</p>

<hr />
<p>As before, there’s clear tracking visible in the data. The boxplots also seemingly confirm our observation of relatively normally distributed variables. It should be noted, however, that LMM assumes normality of model residuals – not necessarily normality of the dependent variable or, indeed, continuous independent variables.</p>
<p>An important fact to realize is that we have no good way of testing any of the model assumptions <em>a priori</em>. Rather, we’ll fit the model and use the diagnostic plots later to assess whether the assumptions are satisfied.</p>
<p>There are some slight ourlier in both groups based on the box-and-whisker -plots (especially subject = 31). Also, subject #28 has a peculiar rise in his/her BPRS score towards the end of the study. However, there are no extreme outliers on individual axes (&gt;3*IQR) so we’ll leave these outliers be for now. Later we’ll do influence diagnostics and deal with any overtly influential observations if necessary.</p>
<p>Judging by the graphs, there’s likely no significant differences between the groups. Overall there’s an apparent decending trend for BPRS in both groups.</p>
<p>Ok, with this, we can dive right into LMM:</p>

<p><img src="chapter6_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-4.png" width="768" /> ***</p>
<p>So, our model residuals for the treatment levels seem rather random. However, it should be noted that this graph is mostly superfluous in this instance: treatment has only 2 levels and a “straight line” can alway be drawn through two points.</p>
<p>The second residual vs week graph shows evidence of a non-linear relationship between week and bprs score. There’s no gross violation of this assumption, however, so we’ll continue with our analysis without any transformations.</p>
<p>The Pearson residual -graph is <em>fairly</em> homoscedastic, although there’s slight fanning to the right. Still, we’ll make do with this mild heteroscedasticity.</p>
<p>The Q-Q-plot shows very good normal distribution of the model residuals.</p>
<p>Next, let’s continue with the influence diagnostics:</p>
<hr />
<pre class="r"><code>#Print influence diagnostics
library(influence.ME)
my_infl_diag &lt;- influence(my_lmm,group =&quot;subject&quot;)

#Dfbetas cut-off for influencial observation is +-2/sqrt(n)
dfbetas_cutoff &lt;- 2 / sqrt(nrow(bprs_wide))
#We&#39;ll use the &quot;4/n&quot; -rule as a visual cutoff for Cook&#39;s distance:
cooks_d_cutoff &lt;- 4 / nrow(bprs_wide)

#Produce the influence plots
plot(my_infl_diag, which = &quot;cook&quot;, cutoff = cooks_d_cutoff)</code></pre>

<p><img src="chapter6_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-2.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>Based on the influence diagnostics, I’d take a closer look at observations 1, 5, and 31 as potential outliers. 31 has elevated Cook’s distance, while 1 and 5 have an increased influence on our intercept estimate as well as week and week:treatment estimates.</p>
<p>In a real data analysis I would rather drop cases one by one while also observing the model AIC to confirm that our model benefits from dropping these observations. For the purposes of this exercise, however, let’s just drop all of these observations at once:</p>
<p>(Also, given the small sample size, I wouldn’t propably drop any observations beyond 31. But let’s play along, here..)</p>
