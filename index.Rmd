This github project page is a part of a course on open data science that I've enrolled in. One of the main subjects on the course is learning R and its application to data management and analysis.

After completing the introductory Datacamp lessons on R my first impressions are:

*   The IDE, the use of a library archive (CRAN), and syntax of R give a Pythonesque impression (not referring to Monty Python, mind).
*   Judging by some peculiarities, I get the impression that R was developed mostly by data scientists rather than programmers.
    +   Firstly, the use of str as a shorthand for "structure" instead of "string" is odd.
    +   Secondly, indices start from 1 instead of 0. Admittedly, a few other programming languages like Fortran also break this convention.
